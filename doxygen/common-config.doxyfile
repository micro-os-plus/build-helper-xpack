# Doxyfile 1.9.7 - differences from original

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").
#
# Note:
#
# Use doxygen to compare the used configuration file with the template
# configuration file:
# doxygen -x [configFile]
# Use doxygen to compare the used configuration file with the template
# configuration file without replacing the environment variables or CMake type
# replacement variables:
# doxygen -x_noenv [configFile]

# If the INLINE_INHERITED_MEMB tag is set to YES, doxygen will show all
# inherited members of a class in the documentation of that class as if those
# members were ordinary class members. Constructors, destructors and assignment
# operators of the base classes will not be shown.
# The default value is: NO.

INLINE_INHERITED_MEMB  = YES

# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES, doxygen will prepend the full path
# before files name in the file list and in the header files. If set to NO the
# shortest path that makes the file name unique will be used
# The default value is: YES.

FULL_PATH_NAMES        = NO

# Doxygen selects the parser to use depending on the extension of the files it
# parses. With this tag you can assign which parser to use for a given
# extension. Doxygen has a built-in mapping, but you can override or extend it
# using this tag. The format is ext=language, where ext is a file extension, and
# language is one of the parsers supported by doxygen: IDL, Java, JavaScript,
# Csharp (C#), C, C++, Lex, D, PHP, md (Markdown), Objective-C, Python, Slice,
# VHDL, Fortran (fixed format Fortran: FortranFixed, free formatted Fortran:
# FortranFree, unknown formatted Fortran: Fortran. In the later case the parser
# tries to guess whether the code is fixed or free formatted code, this is the
# default for Fortran type files). For instance to make doxygen treat .inc files
# as Fortran files (default is PHP), and .f files as C (default is Fortran),
# use: inc=Fortran f=C.
#
# Note: For files without extension you can use no_extension as a placeholder.
#
# Note that for custom extensions you also need to set FILE_PATTERNS otherwise
# the files are not read by doxygen. When specifying no_extension you should add
# * to the FILE_PATTERNS.
#
# Note see also the list of default file extension mappings.

EXTENSION_MAPPING      = no_extension=C++

# Build related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the EXTRACT_ALL tag is set to YES, doxygen will assume all entities in
# documentation are documented, even if no documentation was available. Private
# class members and static file members will be hidden unless the
# EXTRACT_PRIVATE respectively EXTRACT_STATIC tags are set to YES.
# Note: This will also disable the warnings about undocumented members that are
# normally produced when WARNINGS is set to YES.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_ALL            = YES

# If the EXTRACT_PRIVATE tag is set to YES, all private members of a class will
# be included in the documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_PRIVATE        = YES

# If the EXTRACT_STATIC tag is set to YES, all static members of a file will be
# included in the documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_STATIC         = YES

# If this flag is set to YES, the members of anonymous namespaces will be
# extracted and appear in the documentation as a namespace called
# 'anonymous_namespace{file}', where file will be replaced with the base name of
# the file that contains the anonymous namespace. By default anonymous namespace
# are hidden.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_ANON_NSPACES   = YES

# If the SORT_BRIEF_DOCS tag is set to YES then doxygen will sort the brief
# descriptions of file, namespace and class members alphabetically by member
# name. If set to NO, the members will appear in declaration order. Note that
# this will also influence the order of the classes in the class list.
# The default value is: NO.

SORT_BRIEF_DOCS        = YES

# If the SORT_MEMBERS_CTORS_1ST tag is set to YES then doxygen will sort the
# (brief and detailed) documentation of class members so that constructors and
# destructors are listed first. If set to NO the constructors will appear in the
# respective orders defined by SORT_BRIEF_DOCS and SORT_MEMBER_DOCS.
# Note: If SORT_BRIEF_DOCS is set to NO this option is ignored for sorting brief
# member documentation.
# Note: If SORT_MEMBER_DOCS is set to NO this option is ignored for sorting
# detailed member documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

SORT_MEMBERS_CTORS_1ST = YES

# The RECURSIVE tag can be used to specify whether or not subdirectories should
# be searched for input files as well.
# The default value is: NO.

RECURSIVE              = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to source browsing
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the SOURCE_BROWSER tag is set to YES then a list of source files will be
# generated. Documented entities will be cross-referenced with these sources.
#
# Note: To get rid of all source code in the generated output, make sure that
# also VERBATIM_HEADERS is set to NO.
# The default value is: NO.

SOURCE_BROWSER         = YES

# Configuration options related to the HTML output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE tag can be used to specify if the generated HTML output
# should be rendered with a dark or light theme.
# Possible values are: LIGHT always generate light mode output, DARK always
# generate dark mode output, AUTO_LIGHT automatically set the mode according to
# the user preference, use light mode if no preference is set (the default),
# AUTO_DARK automatically set the mode according to the user preference, use
# dark mode if no preference is set and TOGGLE allow to user to switch between
# light and dark mode via a button.
# The default value is: AUTO_LIGHT.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_COLORSTYLE        = LIGHT

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE_HUE tag controls the color of the HTML output. Doxygen
# will adjust the colors in the style sheet and background images according to
# this color. Hue is specified as an angle on a color-wheel, see
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue for more information. For instance the value
# 0 represents red, 60 is yellow, 120 is green, 180 is cyan, 240 is blue, 300
# purple, and 360 is red again.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 359, default value: 220.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_COLORSTYLE_HUE    = 209

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE_SAT tag controls the purity (or saturation) of the colors
# in the HTML output. For a value of 0 the output will use gray-scales only. A
# value of 255 will produce the most vivid colors.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 255, default value: 100.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_COLORSTYLE_SAT    = 255

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE_GAMMA tag controls the gamma correction applied to the
# luminance component of the colors in the HTML output. Values below 100
# gradually make the output lighter, whereas values above 100 make the output
# darker. The value divided by 100 is the actual gamma applied, so 80 represents
# a gamma of 0.8, The value 220 represents a gamma of 2.2, and 100 does not
# change the gamma.
# Minimum value: 40, maximum value: 240, default value: 80.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_COLORSTYLE_GAMMA  = 113

# If the HTML_DYNAMIC_MENUS tag is set to YES then the generated HTML
# documentation will contain a main index with vertical navigation menus that
# are dynamically created via JavaScript. If disabled, the navigation index will
# consists of multiple levels of tabs that are statically embedded in every HTML
# page. Disable this option to support browsers that do not have JavaScript,
# like the Qt help browser.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

# If the HTML_DYNAMIC_SECTIONS tag is set to YES then the generated HTML
# documentation will contain sections that can be hidden and shown after the
# page has loaded.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_DYNAMIC_SECTIONS  = YES

# The GENERATE_TREEVIEW tag is used to specify whether a tree-like index
# structure should be generated to display hierarchical information. If the tag
# value is set to YES, a side panel will be generated containing a tree-like
# index structure (just like the one that is generated for HTML Help). For this
# to work a browser that supports JavaScript, DHTML, CSS and frames is required
# (i.e. any modern browser). Windows users are probably better off using the
# HTML help feature. Via custom style sheets (see HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET) one can
# further fine tune the look of the index (see "Fine-tuning the output"). As an
# example, the default style sheet generated by doxygen has an example that
# shows how to put an image at the root of the tree instead of the PROJECT_NAME.
# Since the tree basically has the same information as the tab index, you could
# consider setting DISABLE_INDEX to YES when enabling this option.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = YES

# The ENUM_VALUES_PER_LINE tag can be used to set the number of enum values that
# doxygen will group on one line in the generated HTML documentation.
#
# Note that a value of 0 will completely suppress the enum values from appearing
# in the overview section.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 20, default value: 4.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

ENUM_VALUES_PER_LINE   = 1

# If the MACRO_EXPANSION tag is set to YES, doxygen will expand all macro names
# in the source code. If set to NO, only conditional compilation will be
# performed. Macro expansion can be done in a controlled way by setting
# EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF to YES.
# The default value is: NO.
