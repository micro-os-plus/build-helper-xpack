## `toolchains/arm-none-eabi-gcc.cmake`

This file can be used when invoking cmake to build projects using
the `arm-none-eabi-gcc` toolchains (bare-metal Cortex-M and AArch32):

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchains/arm-none-eabi-gcc.cmake
```

## `toolchains/aarch64-none-elf-gcc.cmake`

This file can be used when invoking cmake to build projects using
the `aarch64-none-elf-gcc` toolchains (bare-metal AArch64):

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchains/aarch64-none-elf-gcc.cmake
```

## `toolchains/riscv-none-elf-gcc.cmake`

This file can be used when invoking cmake to build projects using
the `riscv-none-elf-gcc` toolchains (bare-metal RISC-V):

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchains/riscv-none-elf-gcc.cmake
```

## `toolchains/gcc.cmake`

This file can be used when invoking cmake to build projects using
a native `gcc` toolchain, instead of the system default compiler:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchains/gcc.cmake
```

## `toolchains/clang.cmake`

This file can be used when invoking cmake to build projects using
a native `clang` toolchain, instead of the system default compiler:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchains/clang.cmake
```
